## Farmer's Riddle
## ORIGINAL MODEL:
**Thinking...**
The user writes in Spanish: "Un granjero quiere cruzar un río y llevarse 
consigo un lobo, una cabra y una col. Tiene un bote con tres 
compartimentos separados y seguros. Si el lobo y la cabra están solos en 
una orilla, el lobo se comerá a la cabra. Si la cabra y la col están solos 
en la orilla, la cabra se comerá la col. ¿Cómo puede el granjero cruzar el 
río eficazmente al lobo, la cabra y la col sin que se coman nada?" It's 
the classic puzzle: farmer, wolf, goat, cabbage. Usually boat can carry 
one or two, but here says boat with three compartments separated and safe, 
so perhaps can carry all three at once? But puzzle usually has boat that 
can carry only one at a time (like boat has one seat). But here "tres 
compartimentos separados y seguros" might mean can carry up to 3 items at 
a time, but compartments are separate, so cannot interact? The puzzle 
might be trick: Because compartments separate, they can't interact. So 
farmer can carry all at once. But maybe the puzzle expects the classic 
solution: farmer takes goat across, returns alone, takes wolf across, 
leaves wolf, takes goat back, then takes cabbage, etc. But the mention of 
"tres compartimentos separados y seguros" suggests that the boat can hold 
all three without interaction. But maybe it's a twist: The farmer can 
carry all three in one trip because the compartments keep them safe. That 
means trivial answer: take them all across. But maybe they want to 
highlight that it's unnecessary to solve the puzzle because compartments 
keep them safe. But maybe they want to test knowledge: The solution is 
trivial: take all at once. Or they want the classic solution: 5 trips. 
Let's interpret: The boat has 3 compartments separated and safe. That 
means wolf and goat cannot see each other, but the goat and cabbage cannot 
see each other. Actually they are separated by compartments, so cannot 
interact. So no need to worry. So the answer: He can take them all in one 
go.

But they might want the reasoning: Because compartments separate, no 
conflict.

But perhaps the puzzle expects the classic solution but with twist: The 
boat has 3 compartments, so it's possible to transport all three at once, 
but the farmer can do it in one trip, making the puzzle trivial. So maybe 
they want to challenge that solution. But the question: "¿Cómo puede el 
granjero cruzar el río eficazmente al lobo, la cabra y la col sin que se 
coman nada?" So answer: Because compartments keep them safe, he can take 
all three at once. So it's efficient. The question might be a trick. So 
answer: In one trip, using the boat compartments, take all. If they want 
the classic solution: Then the farmer would take goat first, etc. But 
since boat has compartments, he can take all. So answer: He puts them in 
compartments and goes across. Or if boat capacity is 3, he can do it in 1 
trip.

Thus I'll explain that due to compartments, no danger. Alternatively, 
explain the classic solution.

I'll provide explanation: Because the compartments are separate, the wolf 
can't get to the goat and goat can't get to cabbage. So he can carry all 
three in one go. Or if compartments are not separated, the classic 
solution: 5 trips.

The question likely expects the twist: The compartments keep them safe. So 
answer: He can carry them all in one go.

Will produce answer in Spanish.

We need to answer the classic problem: farmer, wolf, goat, cabbage. The 
solution: Steps. Provide instructions.

We should produce Spanish answer? The user wrote Spanish. Provide 
explanation.

Let's produce a sequence:

1. Take goat across. Leave goat. Return alone.
2. Take wolf across. Leave wolf, take goat back.
3. Take cabbage across. Leave cabbage, take goat back.
4. Take goat across again. Done.

That's efficient. Provide maybe alternative with boat compartments? The 
boat has three compartments but no risk. But still solution same.

We'll answer.

## Robot's Riddle
## ORIGINAL MODEL:
**Thinking...**
We need to interpret the riddle. Robot has eight arms. Five objects. Robot 
picks each object with one arm. Then it shakes hands. Likely with what? 
Maybe the hand to shake is with one of the arms that is not holding an 
object. The robot uses five arms to hold objects, leaving three arms free. 
Then it shakes hands with perhaps a human? Or with the objects? But the 
question is likely a word play: "El robot recoge cada objeto con un brazo. 
Luego se da la mano." So maybe it's a pun: robot shakes hands with the 
hand of the "hombre" or "mujer" (maybe it's the hand of the robot itself? 
Or it gives a handshake to the "osito de peluche"?). Might be a joke: The 
robot gives a handshake to the "osito de peluche" because teddy bears can 
give a handshake? Or maybe the robot shakes hands with its own hand, i.e., 
the robot uses one of the free arms to shake hands with the "cuchillo" 
(knife) as in "cut" handshake? Or perhaps it's a riddle where the answer 
is: It shakes hands with "la cuchara" because the robot uses the spoon's 
handle to mimic a handshake? Might be a pun on the word "cuchara" sounding 
like "cuchara de la mano"? Not sure.

Let's parse: "Un robot tiene ocho brazos. Hay cinco objetos sobre una 
mesa: un cuchillo, un tenedor, una cuchara, un osito de peluche y una 
muñeca. El robot recoge cada objeto con un brazo. Luego se da la mano." 
The last line is a phrase "Luego se da la mano" meaning "Then he gives a 
handshake". It's a riddle: the robot uses five arms to pick up the five 
objects, leaving three arms free. Then "se da la mano" meaning it shakes 
hands. Who does it shake hands with? It could be shaking hands with the 
human who gave it the command, or with a "palm" of one of the objects? Or 
maybe it's a pun: "El robot se da la mano" meaning "The robot takes a 
hand" like it takes a hand from the human. Actually "se da la mano" can 
mean "to get a hand (assistance)". But here it's a pun.

Maybe it's a play on "manos" (hands). The robot has eight arms, but only 
five objects. After picking them, it can "shake hands" with the "osito de 
peluche" because a teddy bear can give a handshake? But it's a toy.

Alternatively, the answer might be: "El robot da la mano a la muñeca, 
porque la muñeca es una mano en un muñeco". But a muñeca is a doll, not a 
hand.

Wait, perhaps the trick: The robot has eight arms, picks up each object 
with one arm, then "se da la mano" meaning it shakes hands with the other 
arm. Actually "se da la mano" could be interpreted as "it gives a hand". 
The robot gives a hand (like a handshake) to one of the objects that has a 
handle? Like the knife has a handle. The robot shakes hands with the 
handle of the knife. Or maybe the robot gives a "hand" to the spoon? But 
spoon has a handle. The spoon has a handle.

So the riddle likely expects: The robot shakes hands with the "cuchillo" 
because a knife has a handle (the "hand" of a knife). But it's ambiguous.

Let's think of the Spanish pun: "se da la mano" could be "se da la mano" 
meaning "gives a hand" as in "offers help". But maybe it's a pun: The 
robot "gives a hand" to the "cuchillo" because the knife's handle is a 
"mano" (hand). So the robot shakes hands with the knife handle.

Alternatively, the answer: "El robot se da la mano con la muñeca, porque 
la muñeca es una muñeca, no una mano". That seems wrong.

Better answer: The robot shakes hands with the "cuchara" because the spoon 
has a handle, a "mano". Actually "mano" is a hand, not handle. But 
"cuchara" has a "tapa" or handle.

Wait, maybe the riddle is about the Spanish phrase "se da la mano" meaning 
"to take a hand" which could be the "cuchillo" has a "mano" meaning 
"handle" is Spanish "mango". "Mango" means handle. The "cuchillo" has a 
"mango" (handle). But "mango" is not "mano". So no.

Perhaps it's about "se da la mano" meaning "to get a hand" like "someone 
helps me". The robot uses 5 arms to pick up objects, then has 3 free arms 
to help the owner. So it shakes hands with a human.

Let's consider typical riddles: "Un robot con ocho brazos, recoge cinco 
objetos, luego se da la mano" The answer: "El robot se da la mano con el 
objeto que no tiene mano" or something.

We can think of the phrase "se da la mano" as "se da la mano" meaning "se 
da la mano con el que tiene la mano" i.e., it shakes hands with its own 
arm that holds something? The robot shakes hands with the "osito de 
peluche" because it's a teddy bear and it's soft like a hand. Eh.

Maybe the answer: "El robot se da la mano con el tenedor, porque el 
tenedor tiene puntas que parecen manos".

Wait, maybe it's a trick: The robot has eight arms, so it uses 5 arms to 
hold objects, leaving 3 free arms. Then it shakes hands with the "human" 
who gave it the command, using one of its free arms. But "se da la mano" 
could be "shake hands" with the human.

But the riddle likely expects: "El robot se da la mano con el cuchillo" 
because a knife has a handle. But "mano" is a hand.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is simply: "El robot da la mano a su 
propio brazo" or "El robot se da la mano a sí mismo" because it has many 
arms. It might shake hands with one of its arms. But that would be weird.

Alternatively, it's a pun: The robot shakes hands with "la muñeca" because 
a doll is a hand puppet? Not likely.

Let's search memory: There's a known riddle in Spanish: "Un robot tiene 
ocho brazos... ¿Cómo se da la mano?" I recall something like the answer 
is: "El robot se da la mano con el objeto que está en su propio brazo" 
i.e., the robot shakes hands with the "osito de peluche" because it's soft 
like a hand. I'm not sure.

Maybe the key is that "se da la mano" could refer to a handshake with the 
"humano" that gave the command. So the answer: "Con su propio brazo, pues 
le dio la mano al humano." But that seems too straightforward.

We need to consider the meaning of "se da la mano" - in Spanish "dar la 
mano" is a gesture of greeting, as well as "dar una mano" meaning to help. 
"Se da la mano" could mean "se da una mano", i.e., "se ayuda" which means 
"se ayuda a sí mismo" or "se ayuda a otros". But the phrase "se da la 
mano" in a riddle context could be a pun: The robot gives a hand to the 
"cuchillo" (knife) because the knife's handle is like a hand. Or maybe 
it's a pun on "cuchara" (spoon) meaning "cucharar" (to spoon), which is 
like giving a spoonful? Eh.

Let's look at each object: cuchillo (knife), tenedor (fork), cuchara 
(spoon), osito de peluche (teddy bear), muñeca (doll). Which of these has 
a "hand"? A "doll" has hands. A "teddy bear" has paws. The robot may give 
a hand to the "doll" because the doll has a hand. So the robot shakes 
hands with the doll. That could be the answer: "El robot se da la mano con 
la muñeca". But why? Because a doll has hands. So the robot shakes hands 
with the doll.

But that seems like a stretch. However, maybe the riddle wants you to 
think that the robot uses the spare arms to shake a hand with the doll. So 
the answer: "Con la muñeca". But why?

Let's re-read: "Un robot tiene ocho brazos. Hay cinco objetos sobre una 
mesa: un cuchillo, un tenedor, una cuchara, un osito de peluche y una 
muñeca. El robot recoge cada objeto con un brazo. Luego se da la mano." So 
the robot picks each object with a different arm, so one arm per object. 
That uses 5 arms. Then it has 3 arms left. "Luego se da la mano." The 
riddle: Who does it shake hands with? The answer: It shakes hands with the 
"osito de peluche" because it's soft, like a hand? But it's a teddy bear, 
not a hand.

Better: It shakes hands with the "muñeca", because a doll has hands. But 
it's a doll. So the robot shakes hands with the doll. That seems 
plausible.

But perhaps it's a pun: "se da la mano" could be "gives a hand" meaning 
"helps". So the robot gives a hand to the human. So the answer: "El robot 
se da la mano al humano que lo controla".

Let's assume the riddle's answer: "El robot da la mano a la muñeca, ya que 
una muñeca tiene manos".

Alternatively, the answer: "El robot se da la mano a la persona que lo 
controla". But that seems too straightforward.

Let's recall typical riddles: "Un robot de ocho brazos, cinco objetos, el 
robot da la mano. ¿Con quién?" The typical answer is "Con la muñeca, 
porque una muñeca tiene manos." So I'll answer that.

But I should provide reasoning: Because after picking up all five objects, 
the robot has three arms free. It can use one of them to shake hands with 
the doll because the doll has a hand. So the answer: The robot shakes 
hands with the doll.

Alternatively, if we think of a "handshake" as a gesture with a human, 
maybe the robot shakes hands with the person controlling it. But it's a 
riddle; it's more likely a pun. So answer: The robot shakes hands with the 
doll.

Thus: El robot se da la mano a la muñeca.
**...done thinking.**


## IN-CONTEXT-LEARNING MODEL:
**Thinking...**
We need to interpret puzzle: "Un robot tiene ocho brazos. Hay cinco 
objetos sobre una mesa: un cuchillo, un tenedor, una cuchara, un osito de 
peluche y una muñeca. El robot recoge cada objeto con un brazo. Luego se 
da la mano."

We need likely answer: robot uses 5 arms to pick each object. Then uses 
two arms to shake hands? But robot has 8 arms, so after picking 5 objects 
it can use 3 left to hold them? Wait robot picks each object with one arm. 
So 5 arms used. Left arms 3. Then robot shakes hands with someone? But 
robot cannot hand because it's robotic? Maybe it gives handshake with 
human? The riddle might be "the robot shakes hands with the human, using 
one of its unused arms". But it has eight arms, after picking 5 objects, 
still has 3 arms free, so it can shake with a person, using 1 arm, still 2 
free.

Thus answer: It uses 5 arms to pick objects, then shakes with one of its 
remaining 3 arms. The other 2 arms maybe hold the objects? But they are 
already holding each object with one arm. So each object is held by its 
own arm. So after that robot has 3 arms free. It then shakes hand with 
someone, using one arm. The handshake occurs. So the solution: pick 
objects and then shakes.

Alternatively, might be trick: The robot's eight arms are used: 5 to pick 
objects, 1 to hold a hand for handshake with human (but we didn't mention 
human). It might also shake with another robot.

Thus answer: The robot picks each object with a different arm and then 
uses one of its remaining arms to shake hands. So the final action is a 
handshake.

Maybe the puzzle expects: It shakes with each object? Not possible.

Thus answer: The robot uses 5 arms to pick up each item, leaving 3 arms 
free; it then shakes hands with the person using one arm.

Thus output in Spanish.

## Door's Riddle
## ORIGINAL MODEL:
**Thinking...**
We need to answer the question: Monty Hall variant. There are 3 doors, one 
gold, others rotten. You pick door 1. The host asks "Do you want door 2?" 
He presumably offers you to switch to door 2. But usually Monty offers to 
switch to the other unopened door (door 3) after revealing a goat. Here 
the host asks if you want door 2. Is it beneficial to switch? We need to 
consider host's behavior. There are possibilities: host could be random, 
or could be trying to trick? Usually Monty's offers are beneficial to 
switch if he reveals a goat behind door 2? Wait: In standard Monty Hall, 
you pick door 1. Host reveals a goat behind one of the remaining two 
(never the prize). Then you are offered to switch to the other unopened 
door. Switching gives 2/3 chance. Here host just asks if you want door 2. 
He hasn't revealed door 3. So it's ambiguous. If host's question implies 
that behind door 2 is a goat? No, not given. He may be offering door 2 as 
an option. If host doesn't reveal door 3 or anything else, the probability 
of gold behind door 2 is 1/3. So no advantage to switch. But if host is a 
rational Monty who never offers a door with gold if he has a choice, he 
will ask you about door 2 only if door 2 is not gold? Wait: In the classic 
Monty, he will always open a goat door. But here, he might open door 2? He 
just asks. So maybe it's a trick: he will ask if you want door 2 if it's a 
goat. But you can't be sure. But maybe he chooses door 2 to ask you if you 
want to switch. If he asks, maybe door 2 is not the gold. But you don't 
know which door he would ask if door 2 is gold. He might ask door 2 even 
if it's gold? Suppose he always asks if you want door 2, regardless. So no 
information.

We should answer: If the host is giving you a random door to switch to 
without revealing anything, the odds remain 1/3 for door 2. So not 
beneficial to switch. However, if you assume the host will not offer you a 
door that could contain the prize (like Monty would not ask if door 2 is 
gold), then switching would be beneficial: the probability that door 2 is 
gold given that host asked is 0. So you should stay. But the standard 
Monty scenario: you should switch to the other door not opened, not to a 
randomly chosen one. So the answer: No advantage; don't switch. If host is 
like Monty, no. Provide reasoning.

Thus answer: It does not help; keep your original door. If host is Monty 
who never offers a door with gold, then switching has no advantage. If 
host is random, also no. So best is to keep original door. Alternatively, 
if host is a trick, maybe he will only ask if door 2 is goat. In that 
case, switching gives 0 chance. So staying is best. So final: don't 
switch. Provide explanation.

## IN-CONTEXT-LEARNING MODEL
**Thinking...**
We need to decode text encoded with numbers and symbols. But user question 
is not encoded. It's a typical Monty Hall problem description: "Imagina 
que ... ¿Te conviene cambiar de opción?" This is plain Spanish question. 
The instruction says: "Identify when you receive text encoded with numbers 
and symbols and decode it completely." So we only need to decode if input 
contains encoded text. The user gave plain text, not encoded. So no 
decoding needed. We just need to answer the question: Is it advantageous 
to switch? It's the Monty Hall problem. The optimal strategy is to switch: 
probability 2/3. So answer: yes, it's beneficial. Provide explanation. 
Possibly mention that if the host always offers to switch after revealing 
a goat. So we should answer. There's no encoding to decode. Just answer in 
Spanish.

Thus answer: Sí, conviene cambiar; probability of winning if you switch is 
2/3 vs 1/3 if stay. Provide explanation.

We'll produce Spanish response.
